ProductCatalog-WebApi-POC
=========================

An ASP.NET Web API sample for a product catalog service.  

To use the POC, just build and run (Ctrl-F5).  It should start in your local IIS Express.

From there, you can hit it with Fiddler or any other tool you prefer.  There is also a unit test project in the solution you can run to verify things are working.  It’s not a thorough test harness, but it’s enough to verify the basic requirements.
